Puppet::Type.newtype(:stunnel_instance_purge) do
  desc <<-EOM
    Disables all services and removes all associated files for
    ``stunnel::instance`` created resources that are no longer under
    management.

    This is required so that newly created resources do not have port conflicts
    upon starting a new service.

    Example:

      stunnel_instance_purge { 'stunnel_managed_by_puppet':
        dirs => [
          '/etc/stunnel',
          '/etc/rc.d/init.d',
          '/etc/systemd/system'
        ]
      }

      This will disable all services that start with ``$namevar`` and will
      subsequently remove all files in the directories specified in the
      ``$dirs`` Array that match ``${dir}/${namevar}.*``.

      WARNING: BE VERY CAREFUL THAT ${namevar} IS PRECISE
